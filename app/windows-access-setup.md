# Windows Access Setup for AbacusHub

## Current Status ✅
Your AbacusHub application is running and accessible! The errors you see are browser extension issues, not app problems.

## Access Methods

### Method 1: Direct WSL IP (Currently Working)
```
http://172.20.67.92:3000/login
```
**Credentials:**
- Email: `test@example.com`
- Password: `password123`

### Method 2: Windows Port Forwarding (Recommended)
Run this in **Windows PowerShell as Administrator**:

```powershell
# Forward WSL port to Windows localhost
netsh interface portproxy add v4tov4 listenport=3000 listenaddress=127.0.0.1 connectport=3000 connectaddress=172.20.67.92

# Verify the forwarding
netsh interface portproxy show all
```

After running this, you can access via:
```
http://localhost:3000/login
```

### Method 3: Windows Firewall Rule (If needed)
If port forwarding doesn't work, add a firewall rule:

```powershell
# Allow port 3000 through Windows Firewall
New-NetFirewallRule -DisplayName "AbacusHub WSL" -Direction Inbound -Protocol TCP -LocalPort 3000 -Action Allow
```

## Browser Issues Explained

The errors you're seeing are **NOT** from AbacusHub:

### 1. Browser Extension Errors
```
TypeError: can't access property "recordClickType", H.config is undefined
content_script.js:2:527260
```
- **Cause**: Browser extension (likely password manager or ad blocker)
- **Fix**: Disable extensions or ignore these errors
- **Impact**: None on AbacusHub functionality

### 2. HTTP Security Warning
```
Password fields present on an insecure (http://) page. This is a security risk
```
- **Cause**: Using HTTP instead of HTTPS for development
- **Fix**: This is normal for local development
- **Impact**: None for local testing

### 3. CSS Parsing Error
```
Error in parsing value for '-webkit-text-size-adjust'. Declaration dropped.
```
- **Cause**: Browser-specific CSS property
- **Fix**: This is harmless and can be ignored
- **Impact**: None on functionality
