# Test Errors Report

## Date: 2025-07-07

### E2E Test Suite Status

**Status**: ✅ Major CSS selector issues FIXED - Tests now running successfully

### Fixed Issues

1. **✅ CSS Selector Errors**: Fixed all invalid `:has-text()` selectors
2. **✅ Puppeteer API Issues**: Fixed `page.waitForTimeout` and other API calls
3. **✅ Element Finding**: Tests now successfully find and interact with elements

### Current Test Progress (Last Run)

- ✅ Test environment successfully initialized  
- ✅ Browser launching and page navigation working
- ✅ Login page loads correctly with all form elements found
- ✅ Screenshots are being captured successfully
- ✅ Element selection now working with proper selectors
- ✅ Form validation test progressing (empty form submission)
- ✅ Invalid credentials test progressing
- ⚠️ Tests running slowly - need optimization

### Current Issues

1. **Test Performance**: Tests are running but with high timeouts (30+ seconds per test)
2. **API Calls**: Some NextAuth API calls showing errors (401 Unauthorized expected for invalid credentials)
3. **User Menu**: Logout tests failing to find user menu - may need additional selectors

### Test Results Summary

### Next Steps

### Technical Implementation Status
