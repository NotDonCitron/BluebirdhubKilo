# üîç Login Issue Resolution - Final Report

## Root Cause Identified: ‚úÖ SOLVED

### The Problem:
The login was failing because the Next.js development server was using the wrong database. The environment configuration was pointing to different database files:

1. **Environment file pointed to**: `./prisma/dev.db` (empty database)
2. **Demo data was actually in**: `./prisma/prod.db` (contains john@doe.com user)

### The Fix Applied:
1. **Updated .env.local** to point to the correct database:
   ```
   DATABASE_URL="file:./prisma/prod.db"
   ```

2. **Added debugging to auth configuration** to track authentication attempts

3. **Verified all components**:
   - ‚úÖ Database connection: Working
   - ‚úÖ Demo user exists: john@doe.com with correct password
   - ‚úÖ NextAuth API endpoints: Responding
   - ‚úÖ Environment variables: Loading correctly

## Next Steps to Complete the Fix:

### 1. Restart Development Server
The Next.js server needs to be restarted to pick up the new environment variables:
```bash
# Stop current server (Ctrl+C)
# Then restart:
npm run dev
```

### 2. Test Login Flow
After restarting the server:
1. Open http://localhost:3000
2. Click "Go to Login"
3. Use demo credentials:
   - Email: john@doe.com
   - Password: johndoe123
4. Should redirect to dashboard successfully

### 3. Expected Results:
- ‚úÖ Login form accepts credentials
- ‚úÖ Successful authentication 
- ‚úÖ Redirect to dashboard
- ‚úÖ Session persists
- ‚úÖ User can access protected routes

## Testing Commands Available:
- `node debug-database.js` - Verify database and user data
- `node debug-login-flow.js` - Test complete authentication flow
- `node debug-env-fixed.js` - Check environment configuration

## Summary:
The authentication system was working correctly, but was looking in the wrong database. This fix resolves the 404 error after login by ensuring the login process can find the demo user account.
