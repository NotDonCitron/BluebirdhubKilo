# Production Database Errors Report

## Summary
The AbacusHub application is successfully deployed to Google Cloud Platform at https://clineapi-460920.uc.r.appspot.com, but the database initialization is facing critical issues.

## Issues Found

### 1. Database Tables Don't Exist
**Error**: `The table 'main.users' does not exist in the current database`
**Impact**: Authentication fails, user cannot login
**Root Cause**: Database schema is not being created properly during deployment

### 2. Read-Only Database Error
**Error**: `attempt to write a readonly database`
**Impact**: Cannot create users, workspaces, or any data
**Root Cause**: Database file permissions in App Engine environment

### 3. Prisma Client Generation Issues
**Error**: `npm warn exec The following package was not found and will be installed: prisma@6.11.1`
**Impact**: Long initialization times, potential version mismatches
**Root Cause**: Prisma CLI not pre-installed, downloading during runtime

### 4. Database Path Issues
**Error**: Database file creation and permission issues
**Current Path**: `/tmp/app.db`
**Impact**: Database file may not persist between restarts

## Current Status
- ‚úÖ Application deploys successfully
- ‚úÖ Static files served correctly
- ‚úÖ Next.js application starts
- ‚ùå Database schema not created
- ‚ùå Authentication fails
- ‚ùå Cannot login with demo credentials

## Attempted Fixes

### 1. Database URL Configuration
- Changed from `file:./prisma/prod.db` to `file:/tmp/app.db`
- Ensures writable location in App Engine

### 2. PostInstall Script Updates
- Added database file creation in postinstall
- Added schema push to postinstall
- Current: `prisma generate && mkdir -p /tmp && touch /tmp/app.db && chmod 644 /tmp/app.db && prisma db push --accept-data-loss || true`

### 3. Setup API Endpoint
- Created `/api/setup-db` for manual database initialization
- Includes schema push and seeding functionality
- Handles both GET (test) and POST (initialize) requests

### 4. Custom Entrypoint
- Modified app.yaml to use custom startup sequence
- Current: `bash -c "npm start"`

## Remaining Issues
1. Schema push during postinstall may not have database file ready
2. Prisma client generation happening multiple times
3. Database initialization taking too long (timeout issues)

## Next Steps Needed

### Option 1: Use Cloud SQL (Recommended)
- Set up PostgreSQL instance on Google Cloud SQL
- Update DATABASE_URL to use Cloud SQL connection
- Removes file permission issues entirely

### Option 2: Fix SQLite Implementation
- Ensure database file is created before schema push
- Pre-install Prisma CLI in Docker image
- Add database persistence strategy

### Option 3: Use Memory Database
- Use in-memory SQLite for demo purposes
- Seed on every startup
- Accept data loss between restarts

## Authentication Credentials
- Email: `john@doe.com`
- Password: `johndoe123`
- Status: Currently non-functional due to database issues

## Error Logs

```

## Priority: HIGH
The database issues prevent basic application functionality and user authentication.
