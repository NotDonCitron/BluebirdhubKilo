## OWASP Top 10 (2021) Assessment

### A01:2021 - Broken Access Control ⚠️ CRITICAL

**CVSS Score: 9.1 (Critical)**

#### Vulnerabilities Identified:

1. **File Upload Access Control Bypass** (Lines 130-131 in middleware.ts)
   ```typescript
   '/api/upload', // Temporarily public for testing
   ```
   - **Impact:** Anonymous users can upload files bypassing authentication
   - **Proof of Concept:** Upload endpoint is marked as public in middleware
   - **Risk:** Complete bypass of access controls for file uploads

2. **Rate Limiting Disabled** (Lines 96-119 in rate-limiting.ts)
   ```typescript
   maxRequests: 999999, // Effectively disabled
   ```
   - **Impact:** No protection against brute force or DoS attacks
   - **Risk:** Resource exhaustion and abuse

3. **Missing Authorization Checks in File Serving**
   - File serving endpoints lack proper access control validation
   - Users could potentially access files from other workspaces

#### Remediation:
- Remove public access to upload endpoints
- Implement proper rate limiting (5 requests/minute for auth, 100/minute for API)
- Add workspace membership validation for all file operations
- Implement role-based access control checks

### A02:2021 - Cryptographic Failures ⚠️ HIGH

**CVSS Score: 7.5 (High)**

#### Vulnerabilities Identified:

1. **Weak Password Requirements** (Lines 9-12 in validation.ts)
   ```typescript
   .regex(/^(?=.*[a-z])(?=.*[A-Z])(?=.*\d)/, 'Password must contain...')
   ```
   - **Issue:** No special character requirement, no password history
   - **Risk:** Easily crackable passwords

2. **JWT Session Strategy Without Proper Key Rotation**
   - Session strategy uses JWT without key rotation mechanism
   - Tokens could be compromised and remain valid until expiration

3. **Environment Variable Exposure** (.env.production)
   ```bash
   NEXTAUTH_SECRET=zZNf6KYt+L20VNPSfsBnlLhaX44GL7tFuvDc12HWwYo=
   ```
   - **Issue:** Secret exposed in version control
   - **Risk:** Session hijacking and forgery

#### Remediation:
- Enhance password policy to require special characters and minimum 12 characters
- Implement proper key rotation for JWT tokens
- Move secrets to secure environment management (Google Secret Manager)
- Add password history and account lockout policies

### A03:2021 - Injection ⚠️ MEDIUM

**CVSS Score: 6.1 (Medium)**

#### Vulnerabilities Identified:

1. **Basic SQL Injection Prevention** (Lines 155-157 in validation.ts)
   ```typescript
   export function escapeSQL(input: string): string {
     return input.replace(/'/g, "''").replace(/;/g, '');
   }
   ```
   - **Issue:** Manual SQL escaping instead of parameterized queries
   - **Mitigation:** Prisma ORM provides protection, but manual escaping is insufficient

2. **NoSQL Injection Risk in Search Parameters**
   - Dynamic where conditions built without proper validation
   - Could allow malicious queries through search parameters

#### Remediation:
- Remove manual SQL escaping (rely on Prisma)
- Implement strict input validation for all search parameters
- Use whitelist approach for query parameters

### A04:2021 - Insecure Design ⚠️ HIGH

**CVSS Score: 7.3 (High)**

#### Vulnerabilities Identified:

1. **In-Memory Upload Tracking** (Lines 26-37 in upload/route.ts)
   ```typescript
   const activeUploads = new Map<string, {...}>>();
   ```
   - **Issue:** Upload state stored in application memory
   - **Risk:** Data loss on restart, scaling limitations, potential DoS

2. **CSRF Protection Disabled** (Lines 39-50 in middleware.ts)
   ```typescript
   // TODO: Re-enable CSRF protection in production
   ```
   - **Risk:** Cross-site request forgery attacks

3. **Insufficient File Type Validation**
   - File type validation relies on MIME type only
   - No magic byte verification or content scanning

#### Remediation:
- Implement Redis-based upload tracking
- Enable CSRF protection with proper token validation
- Add comprehensive file validation (magic bytes, content scanning)
- Implement virus scanning for uploaded files

### A05:2021 - Security Misconfiguration ⚠️ HIGH

**CVSS Score: 7.1 (High)**

#### Vulnerabilities Identified:

1. **Development Settings in Production**
   - Rate limiting disabled "for testing"
   - Debug logging enabled in production code

2. **Verbose Error Messages** (Lines 149-150 in workspaces/route.ts)
   ```typescript
   error: 'Internal server error',
   details: (error as Error)?.message,
   ```
   - **Risk:** Information disclosure through error messages

3. **Permissive CSP Configuration** (Lines 211-221 in validation.ts)
   ```typescript
   'script-src': ["'self'", "'unsafe-inline'", "'unsafe-eval'"]
   ```
   - **Risk:** XSS attacks due to unsafe-inline and unsafe-eval

#### Remediation:
- Remove development configurations from production
- Implement generic error messages
- Tighten CSP policy (remove unsafe-inline, unsafe-eval)
- Add security headers validation

### A06:2021 - Vulnerable and Outdated Components ⚠️ LOW

   - Rate limiting disabled

2. **Session Management Issues**
   ```typescript
   maxAge: 8 * 60 * 60, // 8 hours
   updateAge: 60 * 60, // Update session every hour
   ```
   - **Issue:** Long session timeouts without proper validation

3. **Missing Two-Factor Authentication**
   - Schema includes 2FA fields but implementation missing
   - No backup codes or recovery mechanisms

#### Remediation:
- Implement account lockout after failed attempts
- Add session invalidation on suspicious activity
- Complete 2FA implementation with backup codes

   - No checksum verification for uploaded files
   - No digital signature validation
   - Chunks assembled without integrity checks

2. **Missing Dependency Integrity**
   - No subresource integrity for external resources
   - No package signature verification

#### Remediation:
- Implement file checksum validation
- Add chunk integrity verification
- Use SRI for external resources
- Implement package verification

### A09:2021 - Security Logging and Monitoring Failures ⚠️ MEDIUM

**CVSS Score: 5.0 (Medium)**

- Limited external HTTP requests
- AI categorization endpoint could be vulnerable if external
- Generally low risk due to application architecture

#### Remediation:
- Validate all external URLs
- Implement allowlist for external requests
- Add request timeout and size limits

## File Upload Security Deep Dive

### Critical Vulnerabilities

1. **Authentication Bypass** 
   - Upload endpoint publicly accessible
   - **CVSS: 9.1** - Critical impact on confidentiality and integrity

2. **File Type Validation Insufficient**
   ```typescript
   fileType: chunk.type || "application/octet-stream"
   ```
   - Relies solely on client-provided MIME type
   - No magic byte verification
   - **CVSS: 7.5** - High risk of malicious file execution

3. **Path Traversal Risk**
   ```typescript

## Conclusion

The AbacusHub application has a foundation of good security practices but contains several critical vulnerabilities that must be addressed before production deployment. The most urgent issues are the disabled security controls (rate limiting, CSRF protection) and the authentication bypass in file uploads.

With the recommended remediation plan, the application can achieve a strong security posture suitable for production use. Priority should be given to the Phase 1 critical fixes, which address the most severe vulnerabilities that could lead to complete system compromise.

Regular security assessments and continuous monitoring will be essential to maintain security as the application evolves and scales.
