# Localhost Connection Issue Analysis

## Problem
- Next.js dev server starts successfully on both port 3000 and 3001
- Server shows "Ready" and compiles successfully
- Cannot access localhost:3000 or localhost:3001 from browser
- Connection refused errors when testing with curl

## Investigation Results

### Server Status
- ✅ Next.js processes are running
- ✅ Server reports "Ready" state
- ✅ Compilation successful
- ✅ API routes accessible (SSE endpoint responding)
- ❌ HTTP connection refused on localhost

### Port Testing
- Port 3000: Connection refused
- Port 3001: Connection refused
- Both ports show same behavior

### Configuration Check
- Environment: `.env.local` configured correctly
- NEXTAUTH_URL: `http://localhost:3000` 
- No conflicting processes found

## Possible Causes

1. **Network Interface Binding Issue**
   - Server may not be binding to the correct network interface
   - Could be IPv6 vs IPv4 resolution issue

2. **Firewall/Security Software**
   - macOS firewall blocking local connections
   - Security software interfering with localhost

3. **System Configuration**
   - Network configuration issue on macOS
   - Hosts file modifications

4. **Next.js Configuration**
   - Server may be starting but not properly listening
   - Middleware or configuration preventing connections

## Recommended Solutions

1. **Try Different Host Binding**
   ```bash
   HOST=127.0.0.1 PORT=3000 npm run dev
   ```

2. **Check System Network Settings**
   - Verify localhost resolution in `/etc/hosts`
   - Check firewall settings

3. **Use IP Address Instead**
   - Try accessing `http://127.0.0.1:3000`
   - Or the actual IP address

4. **Alternative Development Setup**
   - Use different port (already tested - same issue)
   - Use production build locally

## Current Status
- Server appears to start correctly but connections fail
- Issue affects both port 3000 and 3001
- Suggests system-level networking issue rather than application bug

## Next Steps
1. Test with explicit IP address (127.0.0.1)
2. Check system firewall settings
3. Verify hosts file configuration
4. Try production build to isolate dev server issue
