## Key Achievements
- ✅ Fixed port configuration (3001 → 3000)
- ✅ Removed all Playwright-specific selectors (:has-text, :contains)
- ✅ Set BASE_URL environment variable correctly
- ✅ Cleared Jest cache
- ✅ Login functionality working correctly
- ✅ Navigation between pages working
- ✅ Form state management test passed

## Issues Identified
All failing tests show the same pattern:
- `Expected: true, Received: false`
- Helper methods returning `{ success: false }`
- Suggests UI elements aren't being found or interacted with successfully

## Root Cause Analysis
The consistent failure pattern indicates:
1. Selectors may not match current DOM structure
2. Elements might be taking longer to appear than expected
3. Create/submit actions might be failing due to form validation or API issues

## Generated Reports
- HTML Report: `/Users/phhtttps/BluebirdhubKilo/app/coverage/e2e/html-report/e2e-report.html`
- Screenshots saved in: `tests/reports/screenshots/`

## Next Steps
1. Analyze the DOM structure to update selectors
2. Add more detailed logging to helper methods
3. Increase wait times for element appearance
4. Debug why create operations are failing
5. Run individual tests with verbose logging
