Recommended Approach for MacBook:
Instead of recreating the exact Docker container, I recommend:
Clone the repository on your MacBook:
Apply
Run
Use the same Node.js version - Check your current version:
Apply
Run
Install dependencies:
Apply
Run
Set up environment variables - Copy your .env files
Use the same database setup - If you're using SQLite (which I see in your project), it should work the same
Why Not Docker?
